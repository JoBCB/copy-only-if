## copy {only} if: < copying acts > / < acts of copying >

is a live coding piece and score for VII Artishok Biennial 2020 by [Joana Chicau](www.joanachicau.com) — a graphic designer, coder, independent researcher — with a background in dance. Chicau designs web based computational systems to construct new scenarios, imaginaries and hypothesis guided by choreographic concepts. Privileging open source tools and investigation through feminist lens, she combines real-time algorithmic composition & movement studies to rethink participation and different conditions for affective interfacing of bodies and technologies. She has been actively participating and organizing events with performances involving multi-location collaborative coding, algorithmic improvisation, open discussions on gender equality and activism.Recent work, news and updates: https://www.joanachicau.com/joana_chicau_cv.pdf

__Building up on on-going current work:__ 

▪	live coding practice [see more info here](https://jobcb.github.io/):

▪	▪	merging choreographic language concepts with web programming;
    
▪	▪	performing in web interfaces and hybrid collaborative online/ offline settings; 
    
▪	▪	movement studies and gestures; 

    
> "The web maybe seen as a choreographic agglomerate which defines ways of moving collectively and individually, through fluid and complex landscapes of information displays, networked, multimedia environments."

>"Web interfaces - with all of its properties, designed intentions and ideologies - become an experimental stage for bringing into shared consciousness the physicality of code & the corporeality of the machine." 
    

▪	research on copyleft movement [see more info here](https://vvvvvvaria.org/~mb/generative-conditions/) 

▪	▪	open licenses, questioning and rethinking notions that often appear in these techno-legal documents, such as freedom, openness and universal scales;
    
▪	▪	looking into open access, open source and free culture from a space/time specific approach, taking the conditions into account that enable or block generative processes.. 



>Q: What are impossible, desirable and absurd, experimental and utopian (extra-)legal models for the future of authorship?

>Can we invent licences that are based on collective creative practices, in which cooperation between machine and biological authors, need not be an exception?
How could attribution be a form of situated genealogy, rather than accounting for heritage through listing names of contributing individuals?
In what way can we limit predatory practices without blocking the generative potential of Free Culture?
What would a decolonial and feminist license look like, and in what way could we propose entangled notions of authorship?
Or perhaps we should think of very different strategies? — Authors of the Future, an ongoing conversation initiated by Constant (2019-)

> In digital software culture “copy” is used in two different ways in the context of file management and as a new phase of cultural reproduction and as part of copy/paste a cultural technique and aesthetic principle. The two lineages constantly overlap in the modern history of media technologies, where copying, the verb, designates a shift in the cultural techniques of reproduction from humans to machines, and copy, as a noun, presents itself as the key mode of becoming object of digital culture as easily reproducible  and  distributed  packages of cultural memory. 
> [...]  
> Copying  the  product  (mechanical  reproduction  technologies of modernity) evolves into copying the instructions for manufacturing (computer programs as such recipes of production). In other words, not only  copying  copies,  but  more  fundamentally  copying  copying  itself.
> [...]  
> Contemporary forms of copy are intimately tied to the consumer market and the commercial milieu of the digital culture (especially the inter-net), whereas the work done by monks was part of the theological networks where God, in theory, played the key mediator (and the final guarantor of  mimesis) instead of, for example, Sony BMG or Microsoft. Theological issues defined the importance of what was copied and preserved, whereas nowadays the right to copy and to reproduce culture is to a large extent owned by global media  companies. This  illustrates  how  copying is an  issue  of  politics  in  the  sense that by control of copying (especially with technical and juridical power) cultural production is also hierarchized and controlled.
> [...]  
> Similarly for Kittler, “The internet is a  point-to-point  transmission system copying almost infallibly not from men to men, but, quite to the contrary, from machine to machine.”
> [...]
> Copying  is  not  merely  reproducing  the  same  as  discrete objects, but coding cultural products into discrete data and communicating such coded copies across networks: seeding and culturing.

__on the making__

##copy {only} if: < copying acts > / < acts of copying >

The piece is both a programming script that copies itself and displays the conditions within which it can operate.
