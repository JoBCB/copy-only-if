## copy {only} if: < copying acts > / < acts of copying >

a live coding piece and score for VII Artishok Biennial 2020 by [Joana Chicau](www.joanachicau.com) — a graphic designer, coder, independent researcher — with a background in dance. Chicau designs web based computational systems to construct new scenarios, imaginaries and hypothesis guided by choreographic concepts. Privileging open source tools and investigation through feminist lens, she combines real-time algorithmic composition & movement studies to rethink participation and different conditions for affective interfacing of bodies and technologies. 
She has been actively participating and organizing events with performances involving multi-location collaborative coding, algorithmic improvisation, open discussions on gender equality and activism.Recent work, news and updates: https://www.joanachicau.com/joana_chicau_cv.pdf

__Building up on on-going current work:__ 

▪	the format of [live coding](https://jobcb.github.io/)

▪	▪	merging choreographic language concepts with web programming;
    
▪	▪	performing in web interfaces and hybrid collaborative online/ offline settings; 
    
▪	▪	movement studies and gestures; 

    
> "The web maybe seen as a choreographic agglomerate which defines ways of moving collectively and individually, through fluid and complex landscapes of information displays, networked, multimedia environments."

>"Web interfaces - with all of its properties, designed intentions and ideologies - become an experimental stage for bringing into shared consciousness the physicality of code & the corporeality of the machine." 
    

▪	research on [copyleft movement](https://vvvvvvaria.org/~mb/generative-conditions/) 

▪	▪	open licenses, questioning and rethinking notions that often appear in these techno-legal documents, such as freedom, openness and universal scales;
    
▪	▪	looking into open access, open source and free culture from a space/time specific approach, taking the conditions into account that enable or block generative processes.. 


>Q: What are impossible, desirable and absurd, experimental and utopian (extra-)legal models for the future of authorship?

>Can we invent licences that are based on collective creative practices, in which cooperation between machine and biological authors, need not be an exception?
How could attribution be a form of situated genealogy, rather than accounting for heritage through listing names of contributing individuals?
In what way can we limit predatory practices without blocking the generative potential of Free Culture?
What would a decolonial and feminist license look like, and in what way could we propose entangled notions of authorship?
Or perhaps we should think of very different strategies? — Authors of the Future, an ongoing conversation initiated by Constant (2019-)
